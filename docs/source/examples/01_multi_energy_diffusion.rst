Multi-Energy Diffusion Comparison
=================================

This example demonstrates how to set up and execute an advanced analysis of cosmic ray transport simulation inside a stellar wind bubble using SAETASS. We compare the radial distribution of particles at various energies (from 1 GeV to 100 TeV) and under three different diffusion models (Kolmogorov, Kraichnan and Bohm).

It showcases the initialization of a :py:class:`~saetass.grid.Grid` geometry and a :py:class:`~saetass.state.State` containing physical values. These objects are passed into a :py:class:`~saetass.solver.Solver` which evolves the configuration explicitly according to advective and diffusive operators alongside custom source shapes.

The script executes the necessary propagation computations and compares with the analytical steady-state solution (:cite:ct:`Menchiari2024`), outputting a PDF matrix plot.

Workflow Highlights
-----------------------

Here the sections of code of particular relevance are highlighted.

First, the necessary modules are imported from the SAETASS package.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/01_multi_energy_diffusion.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: # 0. Import SAETASS modules
   :end-before: # 0.1 Import end

Then, a parameterization of the specific physical setup we want to simulate is performed. In this example paremeters are defined for a stellar cluster wind bubble using the :py:func:`~saetass.utils.giovanni_profiles.create_giovanni_setup` function.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/01_multi_energy_diffusion.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: # 1. Generate Physical Setup Parameters
   :end-before: # 2. Create Solver arguments
   :dedent: 12

Once the setup is generated, the :py:class:`~saetass.solver.Solver` arguments are created. To this end, a :class:`~saetass.grid.Grid` object is instantiated to represent our geometry and the mathematical assumptions for the advection, diffusion and source operators are explicitly configured.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/01_multi_energy_diffusion.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: # 2. Create Solver arguments
   :end-before: # 3. Instantiate Solver
   :dedent: 12


With everything prepared, the main :py:class:`~saetass.solver.Solver` is instantiated.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/01_multi_energy_diffusion.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: # 3. Instantiate Solver
   :end-before: # 4. Calculate the time sampling checkpoints to plot curves over time
   :dedent: 12

Finally, the simulation is marched forward in time iteratively using the core :py:meth:`~saetass.solver.Solver.step` method.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/01_multi_energy_diffusion.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: # 5. Simulation loop
   :end-before: # 6. Result Normalization
   :dedent: 12

After having done the simulation for each energy and diffusion model, the results are normalized and compared with the theoretical solutions.

Complete Script Overview
------------------------

The complete operational script orchestrates these specific steps inside a structural loop to map different initial energies and diffusion setups, outputting the result graphically.

After running the script, the following figure is generated.

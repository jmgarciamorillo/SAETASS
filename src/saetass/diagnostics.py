r"""
The diagnostics module analyzes the characteristic scales of a configured simulation to detect, before running it, time steps that compromise the accuracy of its numerical schemes.

Each operator reports its characteristic timescale and the dimensionless numbers that control the behaviour of its numerical scheme, evaluated for the time step it integrates in each call:

- **Advection and losses** report their Courant number :math:`\max |V| \Delta t / \Delta x` and the number of CFL sub-cycles performed per call.
  These operators are sub-cycled automatically, so their Courant number measures cost rather than stability.
  Their timescales are the domain crossing time :math:`L / \max|v|` and the shortest loss time :math:`\min p / |\dot{p}|`, respectively.
- **Diffusion** reports its Fourier number, generalized to the non-uniform spherical grid as :math:`\max_i \Delta t\,(G_{i-1/2} + G_{i+1/2}) / (2 V_i)`, with face conductances :math:`G` and cell volumes :math:`V`, which reduces to :math:`D \Delta t / \Delta r^2` on uniform Cartesian grids.
  Crank-Nicolson is unconditionally stable and is guaranteed to preserve positivity when this number is at most one.
  Larger values mainly cost accuracy on features resolved by few cells, while smooth solutions tolerate values of hundreds, which are common in astrophysical setups, so this number is reported but not warned about.
  Its timescale is the diffusion time across the domain, :math:`L^2 / \max D`.
- **With several operators**, the splitting ratio :math:`\Delta t / \tau_\mathrm{min}` compares the global time step to the shortest operator timescale, which controls the operator-splitting and time-integration errors.
  A warning is issued when it exceeds :py:data:`WARNING_SPLITTING_RATIO`, with the number of timesteps needed to bring it below.
- **Pairs of operators** report cell numbers comparing their rates at the grid scale, as the largest value over the cells where both act:

  - the cell Péclet number :math:`|v| \Delta r / D`, with advection and diffusion, tells which of them dominates;
  - the cell Damköhler numbers :math:`(\Delta r / |v|)\,|\dot{p}| / p` and :math:`(\Delta r^2 / D)\,|\dot{p}| / p`, with losses and advection or diffusion, compare the time to cross a cell with the loss time.
    Above one, particles lose their energy before leaving the cell where they are, so their spatial profile at those momenta is not resolved by the grid.
    Momenta with fast losses are often meant to be confined near their sources, so these numbers are reported but not warned about.

Dimensionless numbers are invariant under changes of units, so they characterize the discrete problem itself, unlike the magnitudes of the values handled by the solver.
Since parameters may depend on time, every quantity is evaluated at several times of the simulation and the worst case is reported.

## Overview

**SAETASS** numerically solves the **astroparticle transport equation** in spherically symmetric astrophysical environments; this is, the fundamental equation governing the propagation and energy losses of energetic particles within astrophysical environments such as stellar wind bubbles.

The package decomposes the full transport equation into independent physical operators: **diffusion**, **advection**, **energy losses** and **source**. It evolves them via mathematically robust **operator-splitting schemes**. Each operator is implemented as a dedicated finite-volume solver, ensuring modularity, testability and physical transparency.

## Installation

A quick simple installation to get started using SAETASS can be simply done via `pip`:

```bash
pip install saetass
```

This will install the latest stable version of SAETASS from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/saetass/).

> See the full [Installation Guide](https://saetass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for additional installation options and troubleshooting.

## Quickstart

For step-by-step guides to get started with SAETASS, check the [Tutorials](https://saetass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/index.html) section of the [documentation](https://saetass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

For complete, more advanced examples, check the [Examples](https://saetass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/index.html) section of the [documentation](https://saetass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## Mathematical background

SAETASS solves the following **astroparticle transport equation** in spherically symmetric geometry:

$$\frac{\partial f}{\partial t}
    + \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r^2 u_\mathrm{w}f\right)
    + \frac{\partial}{\partial p}\left( \dot{p} f \right)
    = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial r}
    \left(r^2 D\frac{\partial f}{\partial r}\right)
    + Q.$$

Where:
- $f(t,r, p)$ is the particle distribution function,
- $u_\mathrm{w}(t,r,p)$ is the advection (wind) velocity,
- $\dot{p}(t, r, p)$ is the rate of energy loss,
- $D(t, r, p)$ is the spatial diffusion coefficient,
- $Q(t, r, p)$ is the source term.

The equation is discretized using a **finite volume scheme** and solved by an **operator-splitting routine**, which decomposes the full PDE into simpler, independently solvable subproblems.
